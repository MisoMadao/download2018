# Elastic stack for data analysis
### [Download Innovation Festival 2018](https://download-event.io)
#### Mišo Mijatović @ [Sorint.SEC](https://sec.sorint.it)

This repo contains some material from my talk about the Elastic Stack at DIF 2018.

The purpose of this talk is to give an introduction, both theoretical and practical, to data analysis using the Elastic stack.

Here you can find my slides, data set, configurations and instruction for the demo, enjoy! :D

## Software

You can find all the software here: https://www.elastic.co/products

For this presentation and demo I used version 6.3 of all products.

## Data

I found the data for the demo on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), a great source of data sets for analysis.
The data set used for this demo is [380,000+ lyrics from MetroLyrics](https://www.kaggle.com/gyani95/380000-lyrics-from-metrolyrics)

In order to parse this data with Logstash more easily, I modified the file with a little python script, which you can find here. I am not commenting ths script since is out of the purpose of this presentation.

## Demo

Here you can find 3 guides for the demo on Logstash, Elasticsearch and Kibana.
Our demo will follow our use case: analyse the song lyrics data set.
You can also find a file with all the commands used in dev tools, you can paste that content in your own dev tools.

I have exported all the Kibana objects I have created, you can them import into yours.

## More info

This is not a complete course, although it can be useful to who wants to approach these tools. For the rest, out there is plenty of material to quench your thirst for knowledge :)
