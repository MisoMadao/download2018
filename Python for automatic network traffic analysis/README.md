# Python for automatic network traffic analysis
### [Download Innovation Festival 2018](https://download-event.io)
#### Mišo Mijatović @ [Sorint.SEC](https://sec.sorint.it)

This repo contains some material from my talk about Python for network traffic analysis at DIF 2018.

The purpose of this talk is to give an introduction, both theoretical and practical, to the use of the Python language for the analysis of network traffic.
Python is not the only language that can do this work, but is the one that I use and that I want to sponsor.

Here you can find my slides and the code snippets I used for the demo, enjoy! :D

## Software

I used [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
I also use [PyCharm IDE ](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) but you can use any text editor.

## Demo

Here you can find all the snippets, very vertical to their purpose.
You can also find an enrichment analysis class and a test to use it.
All the snippets are commented with some info and references.
The class is also commented and has some hint on how to make it more complete, you can start from there and then just use your fantasy (or your customers use cases).

## More info

This is not a complete course. As you can see I've put some references in the snippets.
I found much stuff [here](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=python+network), take a look at it.
